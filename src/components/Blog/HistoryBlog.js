                  The history of the province from the Spanish occupation has
                  been replete with events worthy of recollection. As early as
                  the time of the coming of Legaspi to conquer Manila with two
                  of his subordinate officers, Martin de Goiti and Juan Salcedo,
                  the Bulakeños thru their seafaring brothers from Hagonoy
                  showed their instinctive love of country by helping Raja
                  Soliman, King of Manila, fight the Battle of the Bangkusay
                  Channel.
                </p>
                <p className="my-5">
                  The history began when a small settlement of fishermen lived
                  along the coast of Manila Bay before the coming of the
                  Spaniards. Later on, these settlers became farmers after
                  moving inwards as they discovered that the land in the
                  interior part was fertile and very much drained by the network
                  of rivers and streams. These settlers grew and flourished into
                  large and prosperous settlement now known as the province of
                  Bulacan.

                <p className="my-5">
                  It is believed that flowers bloomed in the region when the
                  Spaniards came. Because of these sprawling green orchards,
                  vegetables and profusely flowering plants, as well as the
                  beautiful women, this lovely land had come to be called
                  Bulacan as sort of shortened term for "bulak-lakan" and/or a
                  derivative of the word "bulak" &#40;kapok&#41; which abound in the
                  province even before the Spaniards came.
                </p>
                <p className="my-5">
                  The signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato in 1897 was a
                  brilliant chapter in the history of Bulacan. However, the
                  crowning glory among the series of historical events in the
                  province was the establishment of the Capital of the First
                  Philippine Republic in Malolos. The Malolos Church and the
                  Barasoain Church will be both remembered as the executive
                  headquarters of President Aguinaldo and as the Legislative,
                  from September 10, 1898 to March 29, 1899. It was also in
                  Malolos that the famous and historical document, the Malolos
                  Constitution, was drafted and ratified.

                <p className="my-5">
                  Bulacan is also the cradle of noble heroes, of great men and
                  women. The early people of Bulacan, being descendants of a
                  freedom-loving race, had also risen in revolt like their
                  brothers in other parts of the country. Bulacan was one of the
                  eight provinces, which rallied behind the Katipunan's call for
                  an all-out insurrection against the Spanish tyranny in the
                  late 19th century. It produced the Great Propagandist Marcelo
                  H. del Pilar, the youthful General Gregorio del Pilar, the
                  Propagandist Mariano Ponce, the Tecson, Valenzuela, Torres,
                  Estrella, Viola, Sandico, the famous "Women of Malolos," and
                  Maestro Eusebio Roque &#40;Maestrong Sebio&#41;, among many others.
                  The Bulakeños take fierce pride in their history and tradition
                  and they live by these glories. By these glories, they are
                  quick to display leadership and seek fullest commitment to
                  national goals.
